# README

Welcome to RESTaurants, the Ruby on Rails restaurant review app with a JavaScript front end!
This app is an improvement upon my previous project, which was just the Ruby backend. Most of the
RESTful actions included in that project are done dynamically through JavaScript.

Installation:
  First, fork and/or clone this repo.
  Once in the directory, run:
   'bundle install'
   'rails db:migrate'
   'rails db:seed'
   'rails s'
  Then, move to your browser and navigate to the local host specified in the terminal, most likely being 3000.
